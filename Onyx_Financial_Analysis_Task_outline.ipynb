    "Trend Analysis: Examine revenue and expense trends over the specified time period (monthly and yearly) to identify patterns and anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance Comparison: Compare the financial performance of different business lines to determine which lines are most profitable and which may require cost optimization.\n",

    "\n",
    "Expense Trends: Identify which expense subgroups are increasing over time and assess their impact on overall profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Revenue Sources: Analyze which revenue streams are most significant and whether they are growing or declining.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation Analysis: Explore potential correlations between different variables, such as the relationship between specific expense subgroups and revenue performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analytical Methods\n",
    "Descriptive Statistics: To summarize the data and provide insights into the central tendency and variability of revenues and expenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time Series Analysis: To analyze trends over time and forecast future performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparative Analysis: To compare performance across different business lines and expense subgroups.\n",
